## Projects

Here are some projects I've worked on:

1. [Feed Baby Bowie!](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/861818624/) - As part of the bootcamp I did in 2023, we started with the basics, creating games and animations in Scratch. I created a game inspired by my son Ziggy, and his namsake Ziggy Stardust.  
2. [My digital resume](https://larakoseff.github.io/) - Learn more about me via my digital resume, built with basic HTML, CSS and JavaScript 
3. [Pod is in the Details](https://subtle-croissant-aa7f9d.netlify.app/) - Also forming part of my 2023 coding bootcamp, we built our own podcast sites using React and loading data from an API. Much room for improvement here, but it was a good start.
